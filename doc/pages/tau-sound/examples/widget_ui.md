## WidgetUIDemo

[WidgetUIDemo](https://github.com/dooboolab/flutter_sound/blob/master/flutter_sound/example/lib/widgetUI/widget_ui_demo.dart)

{% include image.html file="examples/widget_ui.png" %}

This is a Demo of an App which uses the Flutter Sound UI Widgets.

My own feeling is that this Demo is really too much complicated for doing something very simple. There is too many dependencies and too many sources.

I really hope that someone will write soon another simpler Demo App.

The complete example source [is there](https://github.com/dooboolab/flutter_sound/blob/master/flutter_sound/example/lib/widgetUI/widget_ui_demo.dart)
