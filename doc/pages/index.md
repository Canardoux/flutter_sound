Flutter Sound is a set of libraries which deal with audio :

- A player for audio playback
- A recorder for recording audio
- Several utilities to handle audio files

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27461460/77531555-77c9ec00-6ed6-11ea-9813-320f943b08cc.gif)

## Overview

Flutter Sound is a library package allowing you to play and record audio for :

Flutter Sound provides both a high level API and widgets for:
