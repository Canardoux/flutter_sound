## Project management

I cleaned the Flutter Sound Project. It was really a mess and I was not able to manage almost 100 issues.
Some issues was from users asking help, some users having bugs, and many enhancement requests.
There were some duplicates, some issues not really clear, ...

Now things are simpler :
- Open issues are just new issues filled by Flutter Sound users, or issues not really understood.
- When the issues are correctly identified (issues that can be started by one of the many Flutter Sound developers 😉 ) it is registered in the TODO list of [the Flutter Sound Project](/dooboolab/flutter_sound/projects/3). This list contains all the issues correctly identified but not still planned. This list has actually 31 tasks in this list. This is many, but I really worried that it were worst. This list is unordered.
- When issues are planned, they migrate to the "planned" column. When an issue is planned, Flutter Sound users can have a better hope that it will be solved soon. This list is ordered from high priority to low priority. This list should not be more than a dozen of tasks. Less would be better.
- When someone (😉 me ?) begins to work on an issue, it migrates to the "in-progress" column. Big tasks must be subdivided in sub-tasks. Github allows that.
- When finished, the issue migrate to the "done" column.

## We need developers

I have the impression that Flutter Sound users do not understand the importance of the current situation. I am actually the only developer. And there is 43 tasks to be done !
As I already told you, I never wanted to be the Flutter Sound project leader. In a few month, I will have to stop working on Flutter Sound because another project is waiting for me. I will stop working on Flutter Sound at least probably during a few months. The current situation is not sane.

##  The &tau; Roadmap

We need more developers (or more time) to solve 43 issues. So, it is necessary to define priorities.

I need your help to define those priorities.
[Here](https://github.com/dooboolab/flutter_sound/discussions/563) are the identified tasks. You can vote for these tasks with 👍  or 👎  .
