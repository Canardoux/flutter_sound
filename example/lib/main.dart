The example source [is there](https://github.com/canardoux/flutter_sound/blob/master/example/lib/demo/demo.dart). You can have a live run of the examples [here](/tau/fs/live/index.html).

This is a demo of what it is possible to do with Flutter Sound. The code of this demo app is not so simple.

Flutter Sound beginners : you probably should look to [SimplePlayback](fs-ex_simple_playback.html) and [SimpleRecorder](fs-ex_simple_recorder.html)

The biggest interest of this Demo is that it shows most of the features of Flutter Sound :

* Plays from various media with various codecs
* Records to various media with various codecs
* Pause and Resume control from recording or playback
* Shows how to use a stream for getting the playback \(or recoding\) events
* Shows how to specify a callback function when a playback is terminated,
* Shows how to record to a Stream or playback from a stream
* ...

The real interest of recording to a Stream is for example to feed a Speech-to-Text engine, or for processing the Live data in Dart in real time.
This example can record something to a Stream. It handle the stream to stored the data in memory.
Then, the user can play a Stream that read the data store in memory.

The example is just a little bit complicated because there are inside both a player stream and a recorder stream,
because the user can select if he/she wants to use streams interleaved or planed, and because he/she can select to use
Float32 PCM or Int16 PCM.

An example showing how to play Live Data without back pressure.
It feeds a live stream, without waiting that the futures are completed for each block. 
This is simpler than playing buffers synchronously because the App does not need to await that the playback for each block is completed before playing another one.

This example get the data from an asset file, which is completely stupid : if an App wants to play a long asset file he must use `startPlayer(fromBuffer:)`.

Feeding Flutter Sound without back pressure is very simple but you can have two problems :

* If your App is too fast feeding the audio channel, it can have problems with the Stream memory used.
* The App does not have any knowledge of when the block given to Flutter Sound is really played.
For example, if it does a `stopPlayer()` it will loose all the buffered data not yet played.
