### 9.19.1

- flutter_sound_web depends on etau and tau_web

### 9.18.0

- startRecorder() calls `AudioSession::configure()` if the app forgot to do it itself

### 9.17.8

- On iOS : force output sampleRate to 48000 ([#900](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/900))

### 9.17.6

- on iOS : in playFromStream() add the same hack than with the recorder ([#900](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/900))

### 9.17.5

- Try to downgrade the Android minSdkVersion to 24 ([#1132](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/discussions/1132)) (we must check with @izmeera2000 and @joshua1996 that's it is OK with ([#1129](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1129)) )

### 9.17.4

- Android : minSdkVersion 28 // 18 works fine for the player, but the recorder needs at least 24 (was 18) ([#1129](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1129))
- Android : buildToolsVersion "34.0.0" (added) ([#1129](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1129))

### 9.17.0

- Remove the dependency on 'com.github.jitpack:android-example:1.0.1' in flutter_sound_core/android/build.gradle. ([#1107](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1107))
- merge PR [#1116](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/pull/1116) : Removes v1 Flutter Android embedding references

### 9.16.3

- Flutter Sound Web : the AudioContext open during startRecorder() was never closed. [(#3)](https://github.com/Larpoux/flutter_sound_web/pull/3). Many thanks to [Joana Mesquita](https://github.com/Trash-Bud) for his/her contribution.

### 9.16.2

- Remove the patch  #9.4.18 that tried to fix [#1040](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1040). This patch did not work correctly ([(#1087)](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1087)) and was worst than the issue itself. 

### 9.16.1

- Fix a bug on Android. The recorded file path was incorrect during StopRecorder() with codec=WAV-PCM16. [(973)](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/973).

### 9.16.0

- Create a static completer in flutter_sound_web (`FlutterSoundPlugin::ScriptLoaded`) that is completed when the 4 scripts are fully loaded. [(#921)](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/921).

### 9.15.61

- Downgrade Java to 17 and gradle to 8.7. Too many problems with Flutter Sound 9.15.54

### 9.15.54

- Fixes a stupid bug on android after seek : the curent position was stucked in a wrong position [(#1087)](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1087)
- Use a recent Java (23), a recent gradle (8.10), a recent Marven and a recent Jitpack

### 9.12.44

- Trying to update gradle (8.10) and Java (22.0) to recent versions. No Succes : keep temporarly the 9.12.0 flutter_sound_core for Android

### 9.12.0

- Stereo recording on Android with Codec PCM16 [(#1086)](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1086)
  - Stereo with Wav codec not implemented. (Simple to do if requested)
  - Number of channels > 2 is not supported
- Stereo playback on Android with codec PCM16

### 9.11.3

- Flutter Sound depends now on `web: ^1.0.0`. [(#1077)](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1077) .
- Remove Record to Stream on Web because the code was incompatible with `web: ^1.0.0`. Streams on Web need some work (Player and Recorder).

### 9.11.2

- Android build.gradle: compileSdk = 34

### 9.11.0

- Ad a new verb for the player API : `setVolumePan`. [(#77)](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/77). Many thanks to [Chang Cheng Wei](https://github.com/changcw83) for his contribution.

### 9.10.5

- Fix a bug when the playback is finished. We must not call `_cleanCompleters()`
- Fixes several minor issues in the examples

### 9.10.4

- Fixes a stupid bug in Flutter Sound Web : the calling table of js did not match the one of dart

### 9.10.0

- Add `isBGService` to openRecorder. ([PR #1066](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/pull/1066)). Thanks to [Mohsin](https://github.com/mdmohsin7) for his//her contribution.

### 9.9.6

Add two safeguards in iOS low level to protect us against asynchronous failures ([#1062](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1062)) and ([#1063](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1063)).

### 9.9.5

- On Android: `Background Service` support. [[#1061](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1061)]. Thanks to [@together87](https://github.com/together87) for his/her contribution.

### 9.9.4

- On Android, moves `attachFlautoPlayer` and `attachFlautoRecorder` from `onAttachedToActivity` to `onAttachedToEngine`. [[#1061](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1061)].

### 9.9.3

- We had some problems with `closeRecorderCompleted` (and probably also with `closePlayerCompleted`) [[#1045](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1045)]. Remove everything about this completer that was not useful.

### 9.9.0 beta-3

- Fixes a regression introduced in v9.8.1 when recording to stream on iOS and Android ([#1056](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1056) and [#1060](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1060))
- Recorder To Stream on Web with `Codec.opusWebM` and `Codec.aacMP4`. ([#1056](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1056)).
- New example `MediaRecorderExample` to show how to record to stream on Web.
- The documentation has not yet been updated
- The iOS and Android platforms has not yet been updated, and are not fully compatible with Flutter Web.
- The `codec:` parameter can be specified. Its value can be either :
  - `Codec.pcm16`
  - `Codec.pcmFloat32`
  - `Codec.opusWebM`
  - `Codec.aacMP4`
- The legacy `toStream:` parameter must be specified. You receive a Stream of `UInt8List` packets on your `StreamSink`.
- The function `requestData()` can be called to update the `StreamSink` with the current `Uint8List`
- The parameter `timeSlice:` can be specified. This is the Duration beetween every automatic `requestData()`. If `Duration.zero` the automatic `requestData()` is desactivated. Its default value is `Duration.zero`.

### 9.8.1 beta-2

- Recorder To Stream on Web. ([#1056](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1056)).
- The documentation has not yet been updated
- The iOS and Android platforms has not yet been updated, and are not fully compatible with Flutter Web.
- The parameter `numChannels:` can be specified. If you do not specify this parameter, the default is `1`.
- The `codec:` parameter can be specified. Its value can be either `Codec.pcm16` or `Codec.pcmFloat32`
- The parameter `sampleRate` is deprecated. Flutter Web always uses the sampleRate supported by the hardware. We cannot change it, because we would have to redo a sampling for that and that would be bad for the sound quality..
- There is a new `myRecorder.getSampleRate()` to get the sample rate used by the platform.
- When you call `startRecorder()` you can choose one of three parameters:
  - The legacy `toStream:` which is compatible with the old `toStream:` parameter. You receive a Stream of `UInt8List` packets. This parameter is not supported for `numChannels: != 1`. This parameter is more or less deprecated, and is kept for compatibility with previous versions.
  - The parameter `toStreamFloat32:` can specify a `StreamSink<List<Float32List>>`. Each packet received by this stream sink is composed of several `Float32List`. There is 1 `Float32List` for each channel. This parameter is the most efficient. Specially on Web and on iOS. This is probably the parameter that the App must use.
  - The parameter `toStreamInt16:` can specify a `StreamSink<List<Int16List>>`.  Each packet received by this stream sink is composed of several `Int16List`. There is 1 `Int16List` for each channel. This parameter is slightly less efficient than `toStreamFloat32:`
- The parameter `bufferSize:` must be a power of 2. Its default is 8192
- The callback `whenFinished` can be specified when playing from Stream.

### 9.7.2

- Don't test the platform if kIsWeb : ([#1055](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1055)).

### 9.7.0

- Flutter Sound Web depends on `js 0.7` instead of `0.6`. ([#1054](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1054)).

### 9.6.0

- New parameter `whenFinished` for StartPlayerFromStream()```

### 9.5.0

- Flutter Sound does not stop automaticaly the player when finished and when the App specifies a callBack "WhenFinished". [[#675](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/675)]. This way, the App can decide to stop the player itself, or it can do other things like a seekToPlayer(0) to restart the playback from the beginning. Exemple :
```dart
startPlayer( ... whenFinished: async (){await player.seekToPlayer(0); await player.resumePlayer(); setState(() {});});
```
- Fix a bug in the stream of "current position" after a seekToPlayer()

### 9.4.20

- Several bugs fixed in Recorder To Stream and Player From Stream on iOS. Probably working, now.

### 9.4.19

-Protect feed() against a stop() during the loop. [#1041](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1041)

### 9.4.18

- Patch _getCurrentPosition() on Android because Android MediaPlayer is buggy. [#1040](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1040)

### 9.4.17

- The patch ### 9.4.15 was very bad. We have crash during the callback. Reverts this 9.4.15 patch.

### 9.4.16

- Downgrade the js dependency in flutter_sound_web pubspec.yaml to ```js: ^0.6.2``` instead of ```js: ^0.7.1```. Not sure this is good. We did that because of [#1040](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1040)

### 9.4.15

- Change the timer function on Android to run it in the current thread : [#1040](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1040)

### 9.4.14

- Rewrite method_channel_flutter_sound to return futures instead of null. [#1041](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1041)

### 9.4.13

- Merge the Pull request proposed by [Rajko Vukovic](https://github.com/rajkovukovic). [#965](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/965) : Its about Howler exports on Flutter Sound Web. Thank you for your contribution Rajko

### 9.4.12

- Do not call resetPlugin() when not in dev. [#1039](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/1039)

### 9.4.11

- Do not set result for each audio session when doing a reset (hot reload/restart). [#938](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/issues/938) : Thanks to [netsesame2](https://github.com/netsesame2) for his/her contribution.
