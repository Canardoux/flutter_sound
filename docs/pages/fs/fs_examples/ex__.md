summary: "Flutter Sound comes with a list of very simple examples."

This code does not pretend to show how to code! The purpose of those examples is just to show how to use the Flutter Sound API.

You can have a live run of those examples [here](/tau/fs/live/index.html).

The example itself is architectured as a driver coded in dart (which is not interesting at all)
and a list of Dart Screens. 

The examples code source are found [here](https://github.com/Canardoux/flutter_sound/tree/master/example/lib).
