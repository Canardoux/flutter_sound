The example source [is there](https://github.com/canardoux/flutter_sound/blob/master/example/lib/recorder_onProgress/recorder_on_progress.dart). You can have a live run of the examples [here](/tau/fs/live/index.html).

This example shows how to use the verb `setSubscriptionDuration()` on a recorder for having an `onProgress()` callback.
There is a slider to show are the playback frequency can be adjusted.

This example is really basic.
