## `Taudio` as a Ï„ Project

`Taudio` is both :

- A wrapper above [Etau](https://pub.dev/packages/etau).
- [Flutter Sound v10.0](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_sound).

The current Flutter Sound version is 9.x. `Taudio` is a new name for Flutter Sound 10.0. Taudio is actually in a developement state. It is an Alpha version. Even not a Beta version. There are many things to do before you can use it. Specially:
- A documentation (TODO)
- A support of the three main platforms:
   - Web (TOODO)
   - iOS (TODO)
   - Android (TODO)

`Taudio` is (will be) released under the Gnu Public Licence v3 (GPL v3). This mean that if you don't want, cannot or maynot release your App under a GPL License, you must stuck with Flutter Sound 9.x. This is not a big deal: Flutter Sound v 9.x will be maintain for a forseable future.

`Taudio` is a complete rewrite of Flutter Sound 9.x. It keeps compatibility with the Flutter Sound 9.x API but adds a new wrapper above [Etau](https://pub.dev/packages/etau).

This project is actually being developed.

Actually this is only a place holder.
