/// Using a player is very simple :
///
/// 1. Create a new [FlutterSoundPlayer()]
///
/// 2. Open it with [openPlayer()]
///
/// 3. Start your playback with [startPlayer()].
///
/// 4. Use the various verbs (optional):

///    - [resumePlayer()]
///    - [setVolume()]
///    - ...
///
/// 5. Stop your player : [stopPlayer()]
///
/// 6. Release your player when you have finished with it : [closePlayer()].
/// This verb will call [stopPlayer()] if necessary.

  /// Note : Flutter Sound does not stop automatically the player when finished.
  /// If you want this, use the **_whenFinished_** parameter.
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  ///
  /// - **_codec:_** is the audio and file format of the file/buffer.
  /// Very often, the `codec:` parameter is not useful. Flutter Sound will adapt itself depending on the real format of the file provided.
  /// But this parameter is necessary when Flutter Sound must do a format conversion.
  /// Please refer to the [Codec compatibility Table](/tau/guides/guides_codecs.html) to know which codecs are currently supported.
  /// - One of the two following parameters:
  ///   - **_fromDataBuffer:_** (if you want to play from a data buffer)
  ///   - **_fromUri:_**  (if you want to play a file or a remote URI).
  ///     The `fromUri` parameter, if specified, can be one of three possibilities :
  ///       - The URL of a remote file.
  ///       - The path of a local file. Hint: [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider)
  ///       can be useful if you want to get access to some directories on your device.
  ///       - The name of a temporary file (without any slash '/').
  /// - **_sampleRate:_** is mandatory with raw PCM codecs (`codec` == `Codec.pcm16` or `Codec.pcmFloat32`). Not used for other codecs.
  /// - **_numChannels:_** is only used with raw PCM codecs (`codec` == `Codec.pcm16` or `Codec.pcmFloat32`). Its value is the number of channels,
  /// - **_whenFinished:()_** : A function for specifying what to do when the playback will be finished.
  ///
  /// Note: You must specify one or the two parameters : `fromUri`, `fromDataBuffer`.
  ///
  /// ## Return
  ///
  /// [startPlayer()] returns a Duration Future, which is the record duration.
  ///
  /// ## Examples
  ///
  /// *Example:*
  /// ```dart
  ///         Duration d = await myPlayer.startPlayer(
  ///             codec: Codec.aacADTS,
  ///             fromURI: 'foo'

  ///         });
  ///         myPlayer.setSubscriptionDuration(Duration(milliseconds: 100));
