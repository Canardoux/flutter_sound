/// - [FlutterSound]. This is the main Flutter Sound module.
/// - [FlutterSoundPlayer]. Everything about the playback functions
/// - [FlutterSoundRecorder]. Everything about the recording functions
/// - [FlutterSoundHelper]. Some utilities to manage audio data.
/// And two modules for the Widget UI
/// - [SoundPlayerUI]
/// - [SoundRecorderUI]
