## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Install

For help on adding as a dependency, view the [documentation](https://flutter.io/using-packages/).

Add `flutter_sound` as a dependency in pubspec.yaml. The actual version is `flauto: ^3.0.0`

The Flutter-Sound sources [are here](https://github.com/dooboolab/flutter_sound).

```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_sound: ^3.0.0
```

### FFmpeg

flutter_sound makes use of flutter_ffmpeg.
Please, look to [flutter_ffmpeg documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_ffmpeg) to see how to add it to your App.

- On iOS you will have to enter something like that in your `Podfile`

```
  # Prepare symlinks folder. We use symlinks to avoid having Podfile.lock
  # referring to absolute paths on developers' machines.
  system('rm -rf .symlinks')
  system('mkdir -p .symlinks/plugins')
  plugin_pods = parse_KV_file('../.flutter-plugins')
  plugin_pods.each do |name, path|
    symlink = File.join('.symlinks', 'plugins', name)
    File.symlink(path, symlink)
    if name == 'flutter_ffmpeg'
        pod name+'/audio-lts', :path => File.join(symlink, 'ios')
    else
        pod name, :path => File.join(symlink, 'ios')
    end
  end
```

- On Android you will have to enter the following line in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```
ext.flutterFFmpegPackage = 'audio-lts'
```

## Post Installation

On _iOS_ you need to add a usage description to `info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This sample uses the microphone to record your speech and convert it to text.</string>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
	<string>audio</string>
</array>
```

On _Android_ you need to add a permission to `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />

```

## Migration Guide

To migrate to `3.0.0` you must migrate your Android app to Android X by following the [Migrating to AndroidX Guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate).

## Subscriptions

| Subscription           |      Return      |                     Description                      |
| :--------------------- | :--------------: | :--------------------------------------------------: |
| onRecorderStateChanged | `<RecordStatus>` | Able to listen to subscription when recorder starts. |
| onPlayerStateChanged   |  `<PlayStatus>`  |  Able to listen to subscription when player starts.  |

## Default uri path

When uri path is not set during the `function call` in `startRecorder` or `startPlayer`, records are saved/read to/from a temporary directory depending on the platform.

## Codec compatibility

Actually, the following codecs are supported by flutter_sound:

|                 | AAC | OGG/Opus | CAF/Opus | MP3 | OGG/Vorbis | PCM |
| :-------------- | :-: | :------: | :------- | :-- | :--------- | :-- |
| iOS encoder     | Yes |   Yes    | Yes      | No  | No         | No  |
| iOS decoder     | Yes |   Yes    | Yes      | Yes | No         | Yes |
| Android encoder | Yes |    No    | No       | No  | No         | No  |
| Android decoder | Yes |   Yes    | No       | Yes | Yes        | Yes |

This table will eventually be upgrated when more codecs will be added.

## FlutterSoundRecorder Usage

#### Creating instance.

In your view/page/dialog widget's State class, create an instance of FlutterSoundRecorder.
Before acessing the FlutterSoundRecorder API, you must initialize it with initialize().
When finished with this FlutterSoundRecorder instance, you must release it with release().

```dart
FlutterSoundRecorder flutterSoundRecorder = new FlutterSoundRecorder().initialize();

...
...

flutterSoundRecorder.release();
```

#### Starting recorder with listener.

```dart
Future<String> result = await FlutterSoundRecorder.startRecorder(codec: t_CODEC.CODEC_AAC,);

result.then(path) {
	print('startRecorder: $path');

	_recorderSubscription = flutterSoundRecorder.onRecorderStateChanged.listen((e) {
	DateTime date = new DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch(e.currentPosition.toInt());
	String txt = DateFormat('mm:ss:SS', 'en_US').format(date);
	});
}
```

The recorded file will be stored in a temporary directory. If you want to take your own path specify it like below. We are using [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider) in below so you may have to install it.

```
Directory tempDir = await getTemporaryDirectory();
File outputFile = await File ('${tempDir.path}/flutter_sound-tmp.aac');
String path = await flutterSoundRecorder.startRecorder(outputFile.path, codec: t_CODEC.CODEC_AAC,);
```

Actually on iOS, you can choose from three encoders :

- AAC (this is the default)
- CAF/OPUS
- OGG/OPUS

Recently, Apple added a support for encoding with the standard OPUS codec. Unfortunatly, Apple encapsulates its data in its own proprietary envelope : CAF. This is really stupid, this is Apple.
To encode with OPUS you do the following :

```dart
await flutterSoundRecorder.startRecorder(foot.path, codec: t_CODEC.CODEC_OPUS,)
```

On Android the OPUS codec is not yet supported by flutter_sound Recorder. (But Player is OK on Android)

#### Stop recorder

```dart
Future<String> result = await flutterSoundRecorder.stopRecorder();

result.then(value) {
	print('stopRecorder: $value');

	if (_recorderSubscription != null) {
		_recorderSubscription.cancel();
		_recorderSubscription = null;
	}
}
```

You MUST ensure that the recorder has been stopped when your widget is detached from the ui.
Overload your widget's dispose() method to stop the recorder when your widget is disposed.

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
	flutterSoundRecorder.release();
	super.dispose();
}
```

#### Pause recorder

On Android this API verb needs al least SDK24.

```dart
Future<String> result = await flutterSoundRecorder.pauseRecorder();
```

#### Resume recorder

On Android this API verb needs al least SDK24.
```dart
Future<String> result = await flutterSoundRecorder.resumeRecorder();
```

#### Using the amplitude meter

The amplitude meter allows displaying a basic representation of the input sound.
When enabled, it returns values ranging 0-120dB.

```dart
//// By default this option is disabled, you can enable it by calling
setDbLevelEnabled(true);
```

```dart
//// You can tweak the frequency of updates by calling this function (unit is seconds)
updateDbPeakProgress(0.8);
```

```dart
//// You need to subscribe in order to receive the value updates
_dbPeakSubscription = flutterSoundRecorder.onRecorderDbPeakChanged.listen((value) {
  setState(() {
    this._dbLevel = value;
  });
});
```

## FlutterSoundPlayer Usage

#### Creating instance.

In your view/page/dialog widget's State class, create an instance of FlutterSoundPlayer.
Before acessing the FlutterSoundPlayer API, you must initialize it with initialize().
When finished with this FlutterSoundPlayer instance, you must release it with release().

```dart
FlutterSoundPlayer flutterSoundPlayer = new FlutterSoundPlayer().initialize();

...
...

flutterSoundPlayer.release();
```

#### Start player

- To start playback of a record from a URL call startPlayer.
- To start playback of a record from a memory buffer call startPlayerFromBuffer

You can use both `startPlayer` or `startPlayerFromBuffer` to play a sound. The former takes in a URI that points to the file to play, while the latter takes in a buffer containing the file to play and the codec to decode that buffer.

Those two functions can have an optional parameter `whenFinished:()` for specifying what to do when the playback will be finished.

```dart
// An example audio file
final fileUri = "https://file-examples.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/file_example_MP3_700KB.mp3";

String result = await flutterSoundPlayer.startPlayer
	(
		fileUri,
		whenFinished: ()
		{
			 print( 'I hope you enjoyed listening to this song' );
		},
	);
```

```dart
// Load a local audio file and get it as a buffer
Uint8List buffer = (await rootBundle.load('samples/audio.mp3'))
    	.buffer
    	.asUint8List();

Future<String> result = await flutterSoundPlayer.startPlayerFromBuffer
	(
		buffer,
		whenFinished: ()
		{
			 print( 'I hope you enjoyed listening to this song' );
		},
	);

```

You must wait for the return value to complete before attempting to add any listeners
to ensure that the player has fully initialised.

```dart
Directory tempDir = await getTemporaryDirectory();
File fin = await File ('${tempDir.path}/flutter_sound-tmp.aac');
Future<String> result = await flutterSoundPlayer.startPlayer(fin.path);

result.then(path) {
	print('startPlayer: $path');

	_playerSubscription = flutterSoundPlayer.onPlayerStateChanged.listen((e) {
		if (e != null) {
			DateTime date = new DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch(e.currentPosition.toInt());
			String txt = DateFormat('mm:ss:SS', 'en_US').format(date);
			this.setState(() {
				this._isPlaying = true;
				this._playerTxt = txt.substring(0, 8);
			});
		}
	});
}
```

#### Start player from buffer

For playing data from a memory buffer instead of a file, you can do the following :

```dart
Uint8List buffer =  (await rootBundle.load(assetSample[_codec.index])).buffer.asUint8List();
String result = await flutterSoundPlayer.startPlayerFromBuffer
	(
		buffer,
		codec: t_CODEC.CODEC_AAC,
		whenFinished: ()
		{
			 print( 'I hope you enjoyed listening to this song' );
		},
	);
```

#### Stop player

```dart
Future<String> result = await flutterSoundPlayer.stopPlayer();

result.then(value) {
	print('stopPlayer: $result');
	if (_playerSubscription != null) {
		_playerSubscription.cancel();
		_playerSubscription = null;
	}
}
```

You MUST ensure that the player has been stopped when your widget is detached from the ui.
Overload your widget's dispose() method to stop the player when your widget is disposed.

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
	flutterSoundPlayer.stopPlayer();
	super.dispose();
}
```

#### Pause player

```dart
Future<String> result = await flutterSoundPlayer.pausePlayer();
```

#### Resume player

```dart
Future<String> result = await flutterSoundPlayer.resumePlayer();
```

#### iosSetCategory(), androidAudioFocusRequest() and setActive() - (optional)

Those three functions are optional. If you do not control the audio focus with the function `setActive()`, flutter_sound will require the audio focus each time the function `startPlayer()` is called and will release it when the sound is finished or when you call the function `stopPlayer()`.

Before controling the focus with `setActive()` you must call `iosSetCategory()` on iOS or `androidAudioFocusRequest()` on Android. `setActive()` and `androidAudioFocusRequest()` are useful if you want to `duck others`.
Those functions are probably called just once when the app starts.
After calling this function, the caller is responsible for using correctly `setActive()`
probably before startRecorder or startPlayer, and stopPlayer and stopRecorder.

You can refer to [iOS documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosession/1771734-setcategory) to understand the parameters needed for `iosSetCategory()` and to the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioFocusRequest) to understand the parameter needed for `androidAudioFocusRequest()`.

Remark : those three functions does work on Android before SDK 26.

```dart
if (_duckOthers)
{
	if (Platform.isIOS)
		await flutterSoundPlayer.iosSetCategory( t_IOS_SESSION_CATEGORY.PLAY_AND_RECORD, t_IOS_SESSION_MODE.DEFAULT, IOS_DUCK_OTHERS |  IOS_DEFAULT_TO_SPEAKER );
	else if (Platform.isAndroid)
		await flutterSoundPlayer.androidAudioFocusRequest( ANDROID_AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK );
} else
{
	if (Platform.isIOS)
		await flutterSoundPlayer.iosSetCategory( t_IOS_SESSION_CATEGORY.PLAY_AND_RECORD, t_IOS_SESSION_MODE.DEFAULT, IOS_DEFAULT_TO_SPEAKER );
	else if (Platform.isAndroid)
		await flutterSoundPlayer.androidAudioFocusRequest( ANDROID_AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN );
}
...
...
flutterSoundPlayer.setActive(true); // Get the audio focus
flutterSoundPlayer.startPlayer(aSound);
flutterSoundPlayer.startPlayer(anotherSong);
flutterSoundPlayer.setActive(false); // Release the audio focus
```

#### Seek player

To seek to a new location the player must already be playing.

```dart
String Future<result> = await flutterSoundPlayer.seekToPlayer(miliSecs);
```

#### Setting subscription duration (Optional). 0.010 is default value when not set.

```dart
/// 0.01 is default
flutterSoundPlayer.setSubscriptionDuration(0.01);
```

#### Setting volume.

```dart
/// 1.0 is default
/// Currently, volume can be changed when player is running. Try manage this right after player starts.
String path = await flutterSoundPlayer.startPlayer(fileUri);
await flutterSoundPlayer.setVolume(0.1);
```

#### Release the player

You MUST ensure that the player has been released when your widget is detached from the ui.
Overload your widget's `dispose()` method to release the player when your widget is disposed.
In this way you will reset the player and clean up the device resources, but the player will be no longer usable.

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
	flutterSoundPlayer.release();
	super.dispose();
}
```

## TrackPlayer

TrackPlayer is a new flutter_sound module which is able to show controls on the lock screen.
Using TrackPlayer is very simple : just use the TrackPlayer constructor instead of the regular FlutterSoundPlayer.

```dart
trackPlayer = TrackPlayer();
```

You must `startPlayerFromTrack` to play a sound. This function takes in 1 required argument and 3 optional arguments:

- a `Track`, which is the track that the player is going to play;
- `whenFinished:()` : A call back function for specifying what to do when the song is finished
- `onSkipBackward:()`, A call back function for specifying what to do when the user press the skip-backward button on the lock screen
- `onSkipForward:()`, A call back function for specifying what to do when the user press the skip-forward button on the lock screen

```dart
path = await trackPlayer.startPlayerFromTrack
(
	track,
	whenFinished: ( )
	{
		print( 'I hope you enjoyed listening to this song' );
	},

	onSkipBackward: ( )
	{
		print( 'Skip backward' );
		stopPlayer( );
		startPlayer( );
	},
	onSkipForward: ( )
	{
		print( 'Skip forward' );
		stopPlayer( );
		startPlayer( );
	},

);

```

#### Create a `Track` object

In order to play a sound when you initialized the player with the audio player features, you must create a `Track` object to pass to `startPlayerFromTrack`.

The `Track` class is provided by the flutter_sound package. Its constructor takes in 1 required argument and 3 optional arguments:

- `trackPath` (required): a `String` representing the path that points to the audio file to play. This must be provided if `dataBuffer` is null, but you cannot provide both;
- `dataBuffer` (required): a `Uint8List`, a buffer that contains an audio file. This must be provided if `trackPath` is null, but you cannot provide both;
- `trackTitle`: the `String` to display in the notification as the title of the track;
- `trackAuthor` the `String` to display in the notification as the name of the author of the track;
- `albumArtUrl` a `String` representing the URL that points to the image to display in the notification as album art.
- or `albumArtAsset` : the name of an asset to show in the nofitication

```dart
// Create with the path to the audio file
Track track = new Track(
	trackPath: "https://file-examples.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/file_example_MP3_700KB.mp3", // An example audio file
        trackTitle: "Track Title",
        trackAuthor: "Track Author",
        albumArtUrl: "https://file-examples.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/file_example_PNG_1MB.png", // An example image
);

// Load a local audio file and get it as a buffer
Uint8List buffer = (await rootBundle.load('samples/audio.mp3'))
    	.buffer
    	.asUint8List();
// Create with the buffer
Track track = new Track(
	dataBuffer: buffer,
        trackTitle: "Track Title",
        trackAuthor: "Track Author",
        albumArtUrl: "https://file-examples.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/file_example_PNG_1MB.png", // An example image
);
```

## Informations on a record

There are two utilities functions that you can use to have informations on a file.

- FlutterSoundHelper.FFmpegGetMediaInformation(_<A_file_path>_);
- FlutterSoundHelper.duration(_<A_file_path>_)

The informations got with FFmpegGetMediaInformation() are [documented here](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_ffmpeg).
The integer returned by flutterSound.duration() is the number of milli-seconds for the given record.

```
int duration = await flutterSoundHelper.duration( this._path[_codec.index] );
Map<dynamic, dynamic> info = await flutterSoundHelper.FFmpegGetMediaInformation( uri );
```

### TODO

- [ ] Seeking example in `Example` project
- [x] Volume Control

## Help Maintenance

I've been maintaining quite many repos these days and burning out slowly. If you could help me cheer up, buying me a cup of coffee will make my life really happy and get much energy out of it.
