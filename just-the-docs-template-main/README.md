# just-the-docs-template

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a [Jekyll] site that:

- uses the [Just the Docs] theme;
- can be built and published on [GitHub Pages];
- can be built and previewed locally, and published on other platforms.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem;
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo).

After completing the creation of your new site on GitHub, update it as needed:

## Replace the content of the template pages

Update the following files to your own content:

- `index.md` (your new home page)
- `README.md` (information for those who access your site repo on GitHub)

## Changing the version of the theme and/or Jekyll

Simply edit the relevant line(s) in the `Gemfile`.

## Adding a plugin

The Just the Docs theme automatically includes the [`jekyll-seo-tag`] plugin.

To add an extra plugin, you need to add it in the `Gemfile` *and* in `_config.yml`. For example, to add [`jekyll-default-layout`]:

- Add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

  ```ruby
  gem "jekyll-default-layout"
  ```

- And add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

  ```yaml
  plugins:
    - jekyll-default-layout
  ```

Note: If you are using a Jekyll version less than 3.5.0, use the `gems` key instead of `plugins`.

## Publishing your site on GitHub Pages

1.  If your created site is `YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-SITE-NAME`, update `_config.yml` to:

    ```yaml
    title: YOUR TITLE
    description: YOUR DESCRIPTION
    theme: just-the-docs

    url: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-SITE-NAME

    aux_links: # remove if you don't want this link to appear on your pages
      Template Repository: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-SITE-NAME
    ```

2.  Push your updated `_config.yml` to your site on GitHub.

3.  In your newly created repo on GitHub:
    - go to the `Settings` tab -> `Pages` -> `Build and deployment`, then select `Source`: `GitHub Actions`.
    - if there were any failed Actions, go to the `Actions` tab and click on `Re-run jobs`.

## Building and previewing your site locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.

## Publishing your built site on a different platform

Just upload all the files in the directory `_site`.

## Customization

You're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like!

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

## Hosting your docs from an existing project repo

You might want to maintain your docs in an existing project repo. Instead of creating a new repo using the [just-the-docs template](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template), you can copy the template files into your existing repo and configure the template's Github Actions workflow to build from a `docs` directory. You can clone the template to your local machine or download the `.zip` file to access the files.

### Copy the template files

1.  Create a `.github/workflows` directory at your project root if your repo doesn't already have one. Copy the `pages.yml` file into this directory. GitHub Actions searches this directory for workflow files.

2.  Create a `docs` directory at your project root and copy all remaining template files into this directory.

### Modify the GitHub Actions workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys your site to Github Pages is defined by the `pages.yml` file. You'll need to edit this file to that so that your build and deploy steps look to your `docs` directory, rather than the project root.

1.  Set the default `working-directory` param for the build job.

    ```yaml
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      defaults:
        run:
          working-directory: docs
    ```

2.  Set the `working-directory` param for the Setup Ruby step.

    ```yaml
    - name: Setup Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.3'
          bundler-cache: true
          cache-version: 0
          working-directory: '${{ github.workspace }}/docs'
    ```

3.  Set the path param for the Upload artifact step:

    ```yaml
    - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: docs/_site/
    ```

4.  Modify the trigger so that only changes within the `docs` directory start the workflow. Otherwise, every change to your project (even those that don't affect the docs) would trigger a new site build and deploy.

    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - "main"
        paths:
          - "docs/**"
    ```
